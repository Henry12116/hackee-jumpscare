# hackee-jumpscare
 An admin tool for jumpscaring hackers. Whenever we would detect someone hacking on our server, we would jumpscare them for a few seconds before banning them ðŸ˜‚. This utility allows specified steam ids (specify in `server.lua`) to use the `/jumpscareon <playerID>` and `/jumpscareoff <playerID>` commands. The on command will full screen display the image above and play a loud screaming sound on repeat until you turn it off.

 Note: You sometimes have to restart the resource before using for the sound to work.
